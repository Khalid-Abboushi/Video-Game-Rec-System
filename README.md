# GameGraph: A Graph-Based Video Game Recommendation System

GameGraph is a Python-based project that recommends new video games by analyzing what games players commonly play together. Instead of relying on genres or critic scores, it leverages co-play patterns to provide more personalized and meaningful recommendations.

- **Multiple Recommendation Modes**:  
  - *Single Game Mode*: Shows top games often played together or exclusively with a chosen title.  
  - *Multiple Games Mode*: Suggests the most connected game(s) based on multiple inputs.  
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with Pygame for intuitive browsing and results.  
- **Custom Dataset**: Based on players‚Äô favorite games collected via Google Sheets (CSV).
